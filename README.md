# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.
It's goal is to show my understanding of React.

## Launching the App

To launch the App:

* git clone https://github.com/fabianfuerst/reactnd-project-myreads-starter
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Using the App
When you launch the App, you see a list of books divided by different shelfs. By clicking the dropdown of a book you can change its shelf. Additionally you can search books, when clicking the plus at the bottom right. When getting results from your search you can also add those to your shelfs. However the search terms are limited.


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
